    <p>I was born in New York, and lived there for three years before moving to Paris. I lived in Paris for the next four years of my life. After Paris, I moved to London, where I finished off elementary school. Four years later, I moved to Seattle, and finally settled down to stay. I finsihed middle school and highschool there. I decided the rain was too much for me, and was drawn to Los Angeles. </p>
    <p class="ital bold"> My experience!</p>
    <p>Through my years of middle school and highschool, I volunteered at an organization called Friendship Circle. This non-profit, works with children who have special needs, and offers an amazing opperunity to foster long-lasting relationships. Because of my work with this organization, I have found a passion for the field of psychology, and specifically how the brain works. I spent hours working with these children, and feel as though I learned more from volunteering here than I ever have in my life. As well as that, I am fluent in French, experienced in moving and acclimating to new environments, and profficient in EXCEL.</p>
